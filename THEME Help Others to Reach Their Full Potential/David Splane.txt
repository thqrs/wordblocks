Introduction:

    Engage: Imagine you're at a crossroads, and there are two signs. One says "Easy Path," the other "Right Path." Which do you choose? Often, the right path isn't the easiest.

    Set the Objective: Today, we're going to embark on a journey to find answers to three essential questions. And to help us, let’s visualize a roadmap:
        The first stop: How did Mordecai exemplify true loyalty and integrity?
        Next, we'll explore: How did Mordecai help Esther to see her unique potential?
        And our final destination: How did trust in Jehovah bolster Mordecai's encouragement to Esther?

    Highlight the Value: This roadmap, dear friends, can guide us to strengthen our relationship with Jehovah and to navigate the challenges we face today.

Biblical Exploration:

    Reiterate the Question: So, our first stop: How did Mordecai demonstrate that gold-standard of loyalty and integrity?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 3:2-4

    Clarification: Now, let’s pause here. Why is Mordecai's refusal so significant? It wasn’t just a personal decision; it was a stand for Jehovah's principles.

    Illustration: Think of a modern-day situation. Maybe at school or work, where you're asked to do something that goes against your beliefs. It's not easy to stand firm, is it?

    Application: Just like Mordecai, we're faced with choices every day. Do we compromise, or do we remain loyal to Jehovah?

    Transition: With this foundation of loyalty, let's move to our next stop and see how Mordecai acted as a guide for Esther.

    Reiterate the Question: How did Mordecai, with insight and foresight, assist Esther in recognizing her potential?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:7, 8

    Clarification: Now, this is interesting. Mordecai saw something bigger in Esther's role, something perhaps divine.

    Illustration: It's a bit like someone recognizing talent in a young musician and encouraging them to pursue their passion, seeing their potential long before they do.

    Application: In our congregations, are we not encouraged to see the potential in our brothers and sisters and help them realize it?

    Transition: Recognizing potential is crucial. But how do we act on it? That brings us to our final stop.

    Reiterate the Question: And now, how did Mordecai's unwavering trust in Jehovah inspire Esther’s courage?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:12-14
    Clarification: Mordecai's words here are profound. He had absolute trust that Jehovah would save His people, with or without Esther's help. But he also saw an opportunity for Esther.
    Illustration: Imagine you're on a team, and the coach says, "Whether you play or not, we'll win." But then he adds, "But this is your chance to shine." It's an invitation, not a command.
    Application: Jehovah provides us with opportunities to shine, to show our loyalty and trust in Him. How do we respond?

Conclusion:

    Recap: Let’s review our roadmap:
        We saw Mordecai’s shining example of loyalty.
        We saw how he guided Esther to see her potential in Jehovah's plan.
        And we were reminded of the strength that comes from trusting in Jehovah.

    Call to Action: With this roadmap in mind, let's ask ourselves: How can we show loyalty, help others realize their potential, and put our unwavering trust in Jehovah?

    Highlight Benefits: By following this roadmap, we can strengthen our faith, support our brothers and sisters, and draw ever closer to Jehovah.

    Closing Thought: As we continue our journey, may we always use the Bible as our roadmap, with Jehovah as our guide and destination.

Phrase to sum up the talk: "Loyalty, Potential, Trust: Our Roadmap to Jehovah's Heart."
