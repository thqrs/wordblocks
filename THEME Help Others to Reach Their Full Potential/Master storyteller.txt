Introduction:

    Engage: In a land not so different from ours, where the winds whispered secrets and the trees bore witness to timeless tales, there lived a man named Mordecai and a young queen, Esther.

    Set the Objective: As the golden sands of time slip through our fingers, let me take you on a journey through three tales:
        Of Mordecai, the steadfast tree that refused to bend to the howling winds.
        Of Esther, the budding flower nurtured by Mordecai, blooming amidst the ruins.
        Of an unwavering trust in Jehovah, the river that flowed silently, guiding them through the darkest nights.

    Highlight the Value: Each tale carries a lesson, a whisper from the past, calling us to listen, learn, and live.

Biblical Exploration:

    Reiterate the Question: In our first tale, what made Mordecai stand tall and unyielding?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 3:2-4

    Illustration: Picture a lone tree on a vast plain, refusing to bow to the fiercest storm. That was Mordecai, a testament to unwavering conviction.

    Application: Just as the tree stands tall, so must we in the face of adversity. Ask yourself, when the winds howl, do you bend or do you stand firm?

    Transition: As the winds passed, our tale shifts to a delicate bloom named Esther.

    Reiterate the Question: How did Mordecai, the steadfast tree, nurture Esther, the budding flower?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:7, 8

    Application: In our lives, who nurtures our growth? And whom do we guide, helping them bloom in their destined time?

    Transition: But beneath every tale, there's a river, silent and deep, guiding our protagonists.

    Reiterate the Question: What is this silent river that guided Mordecai and Esther's steps?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:12-14
    Clarification: This river, my listeners, is trust. Trust in Jehovah. It gave them the clarity amidst chaos, the hope in despair.
    Illustration: Even on the darkest nights, rivers reflect the shimmering moonlight, guiding travelers. Such was their trust in Jehovah.
