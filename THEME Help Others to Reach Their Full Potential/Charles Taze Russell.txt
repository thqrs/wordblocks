    Transition: With such loyalty as a foundation, how did Mordecai assist Esther in her spiritual journey?

    Reiterate the Question: How did Mordecai guide Esther to discern her divine role?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:7, 8

    Clarification: Could it be that Esther's royal position was not mere chance, but divine orchestration? What does Mordecai's understanding suggest about our own roles in Jehovah's plan?

    Illustration: Let’s reason on Joseph's position in Egypt. Was he not also placed for a greater purpose to save many lives?

    (Alternative: And Moses, reared in Pharaoh's house, was he not also chosen for a greater work?)

    Application: As we reflect on our individual roles, might we be inspired by Esther’s story to discern Jehovah’s purpose in our lives?

    Transition: But understanding one's role is just the beginning, is it not? How does one gather the courage to act?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:12-14
    Clarification: Consider Mordecai's deep-seated trust. Is this not an example of the profound faith we should all strive for?
    Illustration: Reflect on the psalmist David’s words. Did he not also put his trust in Jehovah during times of distress?
    (Alternative: Or think of Abraham, called the friend of God. Did his trust not lead him to act even when the request seemed most dire?)
    Application: In our trials and tribulations, might we too find strength by placing unwavering trust in Jehovah?
