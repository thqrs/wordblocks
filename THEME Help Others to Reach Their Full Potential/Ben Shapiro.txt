    Reading the Passage: Esther 3:2-4

    Clarification: Mordecai refused to bow. Why? Not because he felt like it, but because of a principle. Principles aren't subjective; they're objective truths we hold to.

    Illustration: It's like choosing to stand up against a popular but wrong opinion. Just because it's popular doesn't make it right.

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:12-14
    Clarification: It's simple. Trust is the bedrock. Without it, everything else crumbles. With it, even the impossible becomes achievable.
    Illustration: Think of it as the foundation of a building. No matter how beautiful the building, without a solid foundation, it's just a matter of time before it collapses.
