    Set the Objective: This discourse seeks to elucidate upon three pivotal queries:
        In what manner did Mordecai exemplify an unyielding loyalty and unwavering integrity?
        Through which means did Mordecai illuminate Esther's potential and divine responsibility?
        How did an abiding trust in Jehovah become the catalyst for Mordecai's exhortation of courage to Esther?

    Highlight the Value: The profundity of these queries holds immeasurable value for us. It serves as a beacon, guiding our steps in loyalty, in recognizing Jehovah's purpose in others, and in the unwavering courage born of trust in our Creator.

Biblical Exploration:

    Reiterate the Question: How, in the Hebrew Scriptures, do we discern Mordecai's emblematic loyalty and integrity?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 3:2-4

    Clarification: The Hebrew context underscores the gravity of Mordecai's refusal. His abstention from bowing was not mere obstinance but a testament to his allegiance to Jehovah's laws and principles.

    Illustration: Reflect upon the Israelites in the wilderness. When confronted with the golden calf, did they not face a similar test of loyalty?

    (Alternative: Consider the prophet Daniel, who, when faced with a decree against prayer, remained steadfast in his devotion to Jehovah.)

    Application: As students of the Bible, Mordecai's fidelity reminds us of the imperative nature of adherence to Jehovah's principles. It beckons us to introspect: where do our loyalties lie?

    Transition: With this foundation of loyalty established, how did Mordecai proceed in aiding Esther?

    Reiterate the Question: By which biblical means did Mordecai enlighten Esther regarding her divine potential?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:7, 8

    Clarification: The Hebrew texts elucidate Mordecai's discernment. He perceived that Esther's royal ascendancy was not mere happenstance but perhaps an orchestration of divine providence.

    Illustration: Reflect upon Joseph in Egypt. Was his position not utilized for a greater divine purpose to save his family during famine?

    (Alternative: Think of Moses, raised in Pharaoh's court, yet chosen for a grander purpose by Jehovah.)

    Application: It behooves us to ponder: How can we, in our capacities, discern and fulfill Jehovah's purpose in our lives and in the lives of those around us?

    Transition: Having recognized potential, what then fuels the courage to act upon it?

    Reiterate the Question: How did an unwavering trust in Jehovah serve as the bedrock for Mordecai's exhortation to Esther?

    Reading the Passage: Esther 4:12-14
    Clarification: Mordecai's words resound with trust. His conviction lay not in human devices but in Jehovah's overarching purpose and salvation.
    Illustration: Recall the prophet Isaiah's words, "Trust in Jehovah forever, for in Jah Jehovah is the Rock of times indefinite."
    (Alternative: Ponder upon King David's words in Psalms, "In Jehovah I have put my trust." How did this trust guide his actions?)
    Application: In the tapestry of our Christian walk, does not trust in Jehovah become the very thread that strengthens our fabric of faith?
